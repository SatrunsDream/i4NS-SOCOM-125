# Cold Blooded

# Introduction
Our project is dedicated to solving a critical challenge faced by U.S. Army medics: keeping blood cool for extended periods in the field to preserve its viability for life-saving transfusions. In combat situations, the ability to quickly administer blood can be the difference between life and death. However, current solutions for blood storage are limited by size, portability, and duration of cooling. Small and medium storage units only preserve blood for 24-36 hours, and larger units, while capable of indefinite cooling, are bulky and require an electrical power source, making them impractical for use in the field.

Our goal is to develop a portable, efficient, and durable blood storage solution that can maintain the required temperature for extended periods without relying on external power. This project focuses on creating innovative packaging solutions that are lightweight, "squish-proof," and capable of significantly increasing the shelf life of stored blood. By incorporating cutting-edge materials and preservation technologies, such as cyclodextrin treatments, we aim to extend blood viability beyond current limits, providing medics with the tools they need to save more lives on the battlefield.

This repository will document our research, designs, and developments as we work toward creating a solution that could revolutionize battlefield medicine.
